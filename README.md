# Decentralized Agricultural Finance Initiative (DAFI)

## Problem

Small-scale farms, crucial for food security and rural livelihoods, face significant barriers to growth due to limited access to capital, markets, technology, and climate resilience, hindering their ability to contribute to sustainable food systems.

### Detailed Problems:

*   **Lack of Formal Business Structure of Solo Farm Owners:** Many farms operate as sole proprietorships or family businesses with limited formal financial records. This makes it hard for investors to assess their financial health, track progress, and understand their business model.
*   **Competition & Limited Access to Capital:** Traditional lenders often view agriculture as high-risk due to factors like weather dependence, fluctuating commodity prices, and long production cycles. This limits access to loans and other forms of financing. Additionally, the agricultural sector faces competition for investment capital from other sectors perceived as having higher growth potential or lower risk.
*   **Difficulties in Demonstrating Profitability:** Agriculture can be a cyclical industry with income varying significantly year-to-year. Farmers may struggle to consistently demonstrate profitability to potential investors, especially in years with adverse weather or market conditions.
*   **Lack of Business and Financial Skills:** Many farmers may lack the business and financial acumen to develop a compelling investment pitch, create financial projections, and effectively communicate their value proposition to investors.

## Background

*   **UN SDG:** Goal 2 seeks sustainable solutions to end hunger in all its forms by 2030 and to achieve food security.
*   **PH:** The Philippines is a highly agricultural country with a lot of untapped or wasted potential.

## Solution

**Decentralized Agricultural Finance Initiative (DAFI)**

Leveraging Decentralized Finance (DeFi), we can tokenize agricultural assets, enabling anyone to invest in small-scale farms through a transparent and accessible platform, fostering increased capital flow and improving food system resilience.
